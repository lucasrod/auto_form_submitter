# üöÄ Auto Form Submitter

## üìå Overview
Auto Form Submitter is a Python-based automation tool that:
- Authenticates to a website using credentials.
- Monitors, fills, and submits a form as soon as it becomes available.
- Supports scheduling appointments dynamically.
- Uses **Selenium** and **Playwright** for reliable browser automation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
‚úîÔ∏è Automatic login and session handling  
‚úîÔ∏è Form payload customization (JSON-based templates)  
‚úîÔ∏è Appointment scheduler with retry logic  
‚úîÔ∏è Logging and exception handling for debugging  
‚úîÔ∏è Modular and extensible architecture  

## üì¶ Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/auto-form-submitter.git
cd auto-form-submitter
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up a Virtual Environment (Using Conda)
```
conda create --name auto_form_submitter python=3.11
conda activate auto_form_submitter
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install  # Install required browsers
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
### Setting Up Environment Variables
All environment variables live in the `config/` directory. Create one of the following files:

- `config/.env` (fallback defaults):
  ```ini
  ENVIRONMENT=TESTING
  USERNAME=testuser@gmail.com
  PASSWORD=testpass
  GMAIL_USER=testuser@gmail.com
  GMAIL_PASS=testpass
  ```
- `config/.env.testing` (explicit testing mode):
  ```ini
  ENVIRONMENT=TESTING
  USERNAME=<your_test_username>
  PASSWORD=<your_test_password>
  GMAIL_USER=<your_gmail_user>
  GMAIL_PASS=<your_gmail_pass>
  ```
- `config/.env.prod` (production mode ‚Äì do NOT commit real secrets):
  ```ini
  ENVIRONMENT=PROD
  USERNAME=<your_prod_username>
  PASSWORD=<your_prod_password>
  GMAIL_USER=<your_gmail_user>
  GMAIL_PASS=<your_gmail_pass>
  ```

## üöÄ Usage
Run the main script to start monitoring and submitting the form:
```
python src/main.py
```

## üîÑ Execution Flow
When you run `python src/main.py`, the following steps are executed in order:

1. **Load environment**: `utils/env_loader.load_environment()` reads `config/.env*` and sets all required variables.
2. **Initialize logging**: logs are written to `logs/app.log` with timestamp and level.
3. **Authenticate**: `LoginHandler` launches a headless browser, navigates to the login page, fills credentials, and waits for `/UserArea`.
4. **Inspect & submit form**: `FormHandler` analyses the booking form, loads a JSON payload template from `data/form_payload_templates.json`, and submits it.
5. **Poll for availability**: `AppointmentScheduler` checks up to 10 times for available slots (with 1 s interval), and schedules when found.
6. **Cleanup**: the browser session is closed via `login_handler.close()`.

## üß™ Running Tests
To execute the full test suite in **TESTING** mode, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Create and activate the Conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate auto_form_submitter

# 2. Install dependencies and browsers
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install  # download required browser binaries

# 3. Run tests under the testing environment
export ENVIRONMENT=TESTING
pytest -q
```

## üîí Freezing the Environment for Offline Use

If you have limited internet and want to lock down your Python deps **and** Playwright browser binaries, follow these steps:

1. Pin exact Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.lock
   ```
   Ensure `requirements.txt` pins `playwright==1.50.0` so the package version cannot change.

2. Export your full Conda environment spec:
   ```bash
   conda list --explicit > conda-spec.txt
   ```

3. Backup the Playwright browser cache directory:
   ```bash
   tar czf playwright-browsers.tar.gz ~/.cache/ms-playwright
   ```

To restore everything offline on the same or another machine:
```bash
# 1. Create the Conda env from the explicit spec
conda create --name auto_form_submitter --file conda-spec.txt
conda activate auto_form_submitter

# 2. Install Python packages offline (use a local wheels directory or keep pip cache)
pip install --no-index --find-links /path/to/wheelhouse -r requirements.lock

# 3. Unpack browser binaries back into the Playwright cache
tar xzf playwright-browsers.tar.gz -C ~/.cache/ms-playwright

# Optional: prevent any further browser downloads
export PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
```
